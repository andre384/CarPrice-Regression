# CarPrice Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a model with independent variables such as car size or mpg that affect the numerical value of the dependent variable. In this case, the goal is to create a linear model that predicts car price base on the values of independent variables. Linear Regression assumes that each variable has a linear effect on car price. For example carprice = b + theta*(carsize) where car price will increase proportionally to the car size. Often many variables are available in the data and a step for analysis is determing the optimal number of parameters. Mixed Selection is method that chooses variables highly correlated to the dependent variable while also removing variables that are not significant. In this notebook I demonstrate a way to apply this method manually. There various tools and libraries that find parameters automatically but the objective for this project was to show the mechanics of mixed selection.
